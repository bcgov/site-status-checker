# Site Status Checker

Reads web addresses from a CSV file and uses curl to record their HTTP status codes.  Results are provided in a modified version of the original CSV file.  Created and tested on Fedora 32 Linux.

## Usage

### Installation

There is no installation.  The script can be cloned or copied.  If copied, make sure the new file is executable.

Clone method.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bcgov/site-status-checker
cd site-status-checker
```

Copy and paste method.

```bash
<copy and paste into count.sh>
chmod +x count.sh
```

### Parameters

Run the script without parameters for basic help.

```bash
./count.sh 

   Reads a CSV file of websites (header=URL) and outputs their statuses (header=HTTP_STATUS)

     [TIMEOUT=10] ./count.sh ./input.csv [./results.csv]
```

Required: Consume an input file with the first parameter.

```bash
./count.sh sites.csv 
```

Optional: Change the default file output from `results.csv` with the second parameter.

```bash
./count.sh sites.csv output-file.csv
```

### Input and Output Files

A CSV (comma separated value) is expected.  Call the input column header `URL`.  A second CSV file is created with the same content, but adding results under the `HTTP_STATUS` column.  If not present, the column will be created.

`URL` is the default input header.

`HTTP_STATUS` is the default output header.

### Changing Default Behaviour

Input and output headers can be specified at runtime.

```bash
HEADER_IN=URL HEADER_OUT=HTTP_STATUS ./count.sh sites.csv
```

The default curl timeout has been set at 15 seconds, but may be changed as follows.

```bash
TIMEOUT=30 ./count.sh sites.csv
```

A verbose mode is provided for troubleshooting.

```bash
VERBOSE=true ./count.sh sites.csv 
```

Any combination of variables and optional parameters can be specified.

```bash
VERBOSE=true TIMEOUT=30 HEADER_IN=URL HEADER_OUT=HTTP_STATUS ./count.sh sites.csv output-file.csv
```

## Understanding Output

### Excluded

Empty and filtered out addresses will be labeled `Excluded`.

FTP sites and local file shares cannot be used.  E.g. `ftp://` or `\\`.

### No Response

Addresses that do not receive a response will be labeled `No Response`.

This may mean that the address is wrong, has been moved without providing a redirect or is down.

### HTTP Codes

Sites that do respond will receive HTTP status codes.  Please see Wikipedia for a [List of HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).


#### 200 - Success Codes

`200`-codes indicate success.  Any other codes may be generalized as an error.

#### 400 and 500 - Error Codes

`400`-codes indicate client errors.  They are usually related to rights or incorrect addresses.

`500`-codes indicate server errors.  The site could be down, overloaded, timing out otherwise unavailable.

#### 100 and 300 - Unreported Codes

`100`-codes are informational.  These will not be reported.

`300` codes are redirections.  The will be silently followed, resulting in 200, 400 or 500 codes.
